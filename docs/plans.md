## Plans for things that could be and should be done/Ideas
- 4 control schemes: SNES style, SF64 style, SNES style (analog stick), SF64 style (D-pad)  
- Idea for implementing stars/particles: IA texture assigned to object with star behavior (spawn at random x/y and move Z forwards) and particle behavior (self explanatory, see how SNES does those for explosions)  
- MAPS: do it like SF64 does it, long tunnel level thing? Probably use areas to make level longer
- ZREMOVE: check for certain Z distance and kill shape  
- STRATS/PATHS: keep SM64's macros for those, port PATH macros and strat macros from sf1  
- PLANETS.ASM: I kinda want to do 3d models for planets instead of whatever f3d witchcraft sf64 does
