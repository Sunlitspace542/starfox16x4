## Star Fox 16 x 4
(todo: cool logo thing)  
Based on [HackerSM64](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64)

# What the hey is this?
I've started reading through and documenting the source code of the original Star Fox as part of my [UltraStarFox](https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox) fork of the source code.  
I noticed that for SM64, Nintendo decided to reuse the Strategy and PATH macros/scripting languages Star Fox uses.  
Seeing that similarity I lost my mind for probably the 12th time and thought "Hey, I should try porting Star Fox to the N64! That'll be fun, right?" and now I'm here. ~ Sunlit
